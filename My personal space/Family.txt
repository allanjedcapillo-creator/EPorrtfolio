<p style="color:Blue;text-align:center;font-size:30px;">This is my family, I care for them the most in this world they are my guide through my hardships and problems. First is my Dad his name is Jose Aladin P. Capillo and he is a Seaman he is rarely with us since he is mostly abroad but that doesn't stop us from loving him deeply. Next, is my Mom her name is Anabel P. Capillo and She is 49 Years old her birthday and her and my dad's anniversary is on the same day which is May 14, she works as a teacher and always guides me on all my homeworks and performance tasks, Last is my Sister her name is Jana Alexa P. Capillo She is 11 years old and she was born on April 25,2014 she is super hyper and is energetic but she's not really that much of a troublemaker even tho she is very stubborn.</p>
